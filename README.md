# CoupleQuest

## About the Project

CoupleQuest is a web application designed to enrich relationships by offering a dynamic way to generate and manage date ideas. Built using SvelteKit and Firebase, the app provides a seamless user experience for couples looking to add spontaneity and excitement to their plans. With CoupleQuest, users can add, remove, and shuffle through date ideas stored in a Firestore database, ensuring fresh and engaging date options are always at hand.

Key features include:

- Google Authentication: Secure login functionality that allows personalization and privacy.
- Date Idea Management: Add and remove date ideas with ease.
- Shuffling Mechanism: Randomly select a date idea to keep the choices interesting and surprising.
- Activity Tracking: Track whether a date idea has been executed and automatically filter out completed activities for future shuffles.
- Custom Filters: Filter date ideas based on whether they can be done indoors, outdoors, are free of cost, or fit within specific time constraints.
