## About the Project

Couple Quest is a web application designed to enrich relationships by offering a dynamic way to generate and manage date ideas. Built using SvelteKit, the app provides a seamless user experience for couples looking to add spontaneity and excitement to their plans. With Couple Quest, users can add, remove, and shuffle through date ideas, ensuring fresh and engaging date options are always at hand.

Key features include:

- Date Idea Management: Add and remove date ideas with ease.
- Shuffling Mechanism: Randomly select a date idea to keep the choices interesting and surprising.
- Activity Tracking: Track whether a date idea has been executed and automatically filter out completed activities for future shuffles.
- Custom Filters: Filter date ideas based on whether they can be done indoors, outdoors, are free of cost, or fit within specific time constraints.
